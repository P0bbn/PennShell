# Penn-Shell
A simple shell program to take user input and redirect it using CLI arguments. Input is redirected either to a stdout file or to another process using pipelining.
This program was designed using a customized Ubuntu VM. 

## Installation and Use
1. Download the repository.
2. In the project directory, execute the `make` command. This project was designed to be compiled using **clang**. Using **GCC** may not work
3. To start the program, run `./penn-sh`.
4. Apply your own redirect commands to test the functionality. The program **cannot** handle multiple redirects. 

## Note on Access
At the request of University of Pennsylvania instruction staff, I have encrypted and removed from public view the following projects in support of Penn's academic integrity goals.

Penn-Shell; Penn-Shredder; Penn-Shake; Penn-Chord and Penn-Search

Please email/message me if you are a recruiter/prospective employer and would like access to the full repositories for each project. I'll be happy to send you the decryption key. Thanks!
